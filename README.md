A React.js [tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## Develop

To develop, install the dependencies with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and launch the [webpack dev server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html):

```bash
npm install
npm run webpack-serve
```

## Build

Build static files in the public directory with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Deploy

After building, you can host the public directory somewhere, like [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
